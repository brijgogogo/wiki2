## Gamer Switches
Gamer switches have a much shallower activation point, which is where the keypress is registered. This shallower activation point means that when you double or triple tap a key in quick succession, the keyboard can register each hit. In simple terms, you donâ€™t have to press all the way down to activate the switch.
