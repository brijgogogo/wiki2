## Keyboard Switches:
- Switches lets you put something else in the on or off position
- left/right buttons of a mouse actually have the same types of switches as keyboards
- when you press down a key on your keyboard, that lets your keyboard know that you have ‘activated’ that key, which then, in turn, lets your computer know that you typed that letter, symbol, or macro. Your keyboard’s keys are in the ‘off’ position until you press them, ergo the term ‘switch’ (as in, switching them on).
- switches are named after their color

* switches types
- Membrane:  three layers of silicone or rubber with the middle layer acting as an insulator so that when you press a key down, you connect the top and bottom layers to create a circuit and ‘switch’ the key on.
  - quieter than Mechanical
  - more affordable as  made of plastic, hence lighter, hence portable
  - keys won't register unless you press all the way (fast typist won't like it)
  - keycaps are generally non-removable, hence difficult to clean
- Mechanical
  - built with durable, often spring activated key switches, rather than a rubber dome.
  - customization: easy to replace keycaps and key switches
  - faster key press registration (depends on switch style)
  - lifespan: 30 to 70 million clicks (more than membrane)
  - loud

80% / TKL Keyboards (Tenkeyless): standard full-sized keyboards without a tenkey / numberpad.

## Keyboard keycaps
- ABS plastic
- PBT plastic
  - hard, durable, more resilient agains heat and chemicals than ABS
  - ledgends on PBT keys are often laser-etched or dye-sublimated
  - does not turn yellow from exposure to ultraviolet light, like ABS does
- PVC plastic
 - average hardness and friction, but is sensitive to high heat, which will warp it.
 - PVC legends are often pad printed or stickers
