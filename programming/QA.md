# QA
- knowing what needs to be done and making sure it gets done (validation and order)
- QA plan - record all of the steps you'll take to ensure that your product is functioning as intended.
- QA plan is a living document, you will update it when:
  - new features
  - changes in existing features
  - removed features
  - changes in testing technologies or techniques
  - defects that were missed by the QA plan

Defects will occur, no matter how strong QA. Ask: "how could we have prevented this?"

Sometimes it’s better to come to market with something that’s less than perfect than to come to market with the perfect product months later.

Web development - quality:
- Reach: market penetration of your product. Reach more customers. (SEO)
- Functionality: helps in user retention.
- Usability: Is the functionality delivered in a way that is useful to the target audience? Is it easy to use for target audience? (user testing)
- Aesthetics: Do routine reviews of your site's aesthetics. Aesthetics is time sensitive and audience specific.

Unit tests
Integration tests


Continuous Integration
- runs some or all of your tests everytime you contribute code to a source code repository
# CI Servers
- Travis CI
- CircleCI


It is the duty of a Webmaster to allocate URIs which you will be able to stand by in 2 years, in 20 years, in 200 years. This needs thought, and organization, and commitment.
