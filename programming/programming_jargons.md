# programming jargons

* hydrate
fill and empty object

* banana problem
I know how to spell "banana," but I don't know when to stop

* Fencepost errors
not knowing whether to count the fenceposts or the spaces between them

* "Off by one" error

* Heisenbug
debugging that changes the behavior of the system system being debugged

* response sets
number of functions directly invoked by methods of the class

* fork
create a new copy of existing process or duplicating the existing process,

* idiomatic
using, containing, or denoting expressions that are natural to a native speaker.
Using a propety instead of a method feels more idiomatic in C#

* Duck Typing
The general term for "type checks" that make assumptions about a value's "type" based on its shape (what properties are present) is called "duck typing" -- "If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it must be a duck".

* Scaffolding
scaffolding gives you some kind of a (fast, simplified, temporary) structure for your project, on which you can rely to build the real project.
It could be db-scripts, models, views, controllers, CRUD, etc.

* Object graph
object which contains other objects

* Mask
a special value that acts as a data filter. It reveals some parts of digital information, and conceals or alters others.

* Bitmask
- In binary operations, a bitmask can be used to filter bit values using logical operations.
- For instance, a bitmask of 00001111, when used with the boolean AND operation, will always convert the first four bits of another byte (the other operand) to 0. The final four bits will be unchanged. This operation is called "masking out" the first four bits, changing them to 0.

* Netmask
- A type of bitmask, used in computer networking.
- One type of netmask, a subnet mask, defines logical divisions ("subnets") of a computer network. For instance, a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 masks out the first three bytes of an IP address, leaving only the final byte â€” the host identifier.

* Searchmask
*.exe refers to all file with extension "exe"

* Umask
In *nix systems, umask is a mask of octal values that sets the permissions of new files

* Spaghetti code
variables are used and modified all over a program
Program becomes very hard to understand and extremely dificult to maintain and modify.

* REPL: read evaluate print loop

* Vertical Scaling / Scalilng Up : adding resources to increase the power of an existing server. E.g add CPUs, add more memory.
* Horizontal Scaling / Scaling Out: adding more servers that function together as one unit.

* Redundancy / Faut Tolerance

* Economies of Scale: abilities to do things more efficiently or at a lower-cost per unit when operating at a larger scale.

* entropic functionality: functionality that is random (like response based on randon number generation)

* run-of-the-mill application: lacking unusual or special aspects

* monkey patch : to extend or modify supporting system software locally (affecting only the running instance of the program)

* guerrilla patch: changing code sneakily, and possibly incompatibly with other such patches, at runtime.

* orthogonal : different/ statistically independent (This is orthogonal to how Functional Programming approaches the same problem)

* Cohesion - the drive to have related code grouped together.

* Single Responsibility Principle: Gather together those things that change for the same reason, and separate those things that change for different reasons.

* Spaghetti code
Global variables (created in the main program code of python) can legally be used inside functions. However, it is strongly recommended to never do this. Using global variables inside functions leads to a poor coding practice called spaghetti code, where these variables can be used and modified all over a program. This style of programming makes the code very hard to understand and extremely difficult to maintain and modify, because any call to any function might change one or more global variables.

* Dereferencing
Dereferencing a variable means to access one of its members using the . (dot) operator.

* false positive
a test result which incorrectly indicates that a particular condition or attribute is present.
