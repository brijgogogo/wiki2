# Database terms

## Replication is a process that enables you to have multiple copies of the data copied automatically from 'master' to 'slave' databases. There are multiple benefits, with a few of them being:
  - backup
  - spreading the load to improve performance
  - analytics team can work on one of the slave databases, thus not hurting the performance of the main database in case of long-running and intensive queries


## Clustering, in the context of databases, refers to using shared storage and providing multiple database front-ends for clients. The front-end servers share an IP address and cluster network name that clients use to connect, and they decide among themselves who is currently in charge of serving client requests.
