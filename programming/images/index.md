## Image Optimization
- creating lowest file size with good-quality image
- Dimensions of image should be close to actual display size to enable speedy browser rendering of the image.
- Crop image or create thumbnail image that links to a larger version of the image.
- Antialiasing introduces intermediate colors to smooth jagged edges in digital images.

Lossless Compression: nothing in the original image is lost, and the compresse image when rendered by a browser will contains the same pixels as the original
Lossy compression: some pixels in the original image are lost or removed from the compressed file. When a browser renders the compressed image, the display is similar to but not exactly the same as the original image.

Pixelation: square blocks seen in image when we try to reduce its quality by compression (like 20% quality jpeg)

Cinemagraph: GIF created by taking a video or series of photos with small changes (like hair waiving in the wind)
