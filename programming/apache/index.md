# apache web server
* Configuration: XML syntax
* Distributed .htaccess files (at root, subdirectories)
* Dynamic content is natively processed with modules (for e.g. php, perl can be part of apache binary, so dynamic content requests can be processed by apache itself)
* Static content is less efficient (compared to nginx)
* Caching and load balancing capabilities with modules
