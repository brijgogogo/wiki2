# development methods
* Waterfall
There would be handoffs at each stage of the software development life cycle
(SDLC): from planning, development, quality assurance and operations. With
knowledge lost during the silos, operations issues would never be fed back
down to developers; to the same end, business intent would never make it up
the chain to developers.

* Agile
Agile development further aligned business intent and application knowledge with
the product owner, developers and quality assurance on the same team. However,
it was still someone elseâ€™s problem to operate the software.

* DevOps
