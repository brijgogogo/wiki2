# cloud computing
A cloud is made up of computer's owned by people/organizations that lease usage of those computers to others.

## benefits
* High Availability: data is available from mutliple places (protection against disk failure, power failure, etc.)
* Fault Tolerant: zero downtime: data is backed up, more instances can be invoked if one fails.
* Scalable : more instances can be created based on need/growth
* Elastic : instances can be reduced or increased based on need

## Types of Cloud Computing Services
* IaaS: Infrastructure-as-a-Service  => Host  -> OS, Network connectivity
* PaaS: Platform-as-a-Service        => Build -> web server, storage
* SaaS: Software-as-a-Service        => Consume -> applications like Office 365

### What is managed by You vs Vendor
- On-Premise:
  - Managed by you: Applicaitons, Data, Runtime, Middleware, OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking
- IaaS:
  - Managed by you: Applicaitons, Data, Runtime, Middleware, OS
  - Managed by vendor: Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking
- PaaS:
  - Managed by you: Applicaitons, Data,
  - Managed by vendor: Runtime, Middleware, OS, Virtualization, Servers, Storage, Networking
- SaaS:

### Cloud Providers
- IaaS: Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine
- PaaS: Azure Logic Apps, Heroku, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk
- SaaS: Office 365, Google G Suite, Salesforce, Dropbox

### Usage
- IaaS:
  - Test and development
  - Storage and backups
  - High performance computing
  - Big data analysis
- PaaS:
  - Analytics or business intelligence
  - Development framework: create apps using built in features
- SaaS:
  - Gain access to suphisticated applications
  - Mobilize your workforce easily (add/remove users easily)

## Cloud computing deployment models
Public cloud
Private cloud (eg. Azure Stack)
Hybrid cloud
Community cloud (eg. Azure Government, Azure Germany, etc)
