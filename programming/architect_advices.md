# Architect advices
- Shift thinking away from creating the perfect end product, and instead focus on helping create a framework in which the right systems can emerge, and continue to grow as we learn more.

- We cannot foresee everything that will happen, and so rather than plan for any eventuality, we should plan to allow for change by avoiding the urge to overspecify every last thing.

- Arechitect role is more like town planner.

- Ensure that the system is fit for purpose now, but also a platform for the future.

- Ensure the system makes users and developers equally happy.

- Strategic Goals => Architectural Principles => Design and Delivery practices
