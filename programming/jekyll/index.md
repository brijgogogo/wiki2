# jekyll
static site generator
- uses markup language

## installation
- ruby development environment
- gem install jekyll bundler

## commands
* jekyll new <blog_name>
* bundle exec jekyll serve
start website
* jekyll build



* bundle init
to create a new Gemfile to list your project’s dependencies run:
* bundle install
installs the gems from Gemfile and creates Gemfile.lock which locks the current gem versions for a future bundle install
* bundle update
to update gems
* When using a Gemfile, you’ll run commands like jekyll serve with bundle exec prefixed. So the full command is:
bundle exec jekyll serve


Any time you update _config.yml you’ll need to restart Jekyll for the changes to take affect.

It’s good practice to have a Gemfile for your site. This ensures the version of Jekyll and other gems remains consistent across different environments.
