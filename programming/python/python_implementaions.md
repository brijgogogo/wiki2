# Python Implementations

Python Language - specification that defines a set of rules and grammer for writting Python code
Python Implementation - program that understands those rules and can execute Python code


implementations:
* [CPython](CPython) (default implementaion)
* [Jython](Jython) (written in Java)
* [IronPython](IronPython) (written in C#)
* [PyPy](PyPy) (written in subset of Python itself)
* Pyston
*


Ideally all implementations should be able to run Python code. Certain features may be available in one implementation and not other or they may behave differently.
