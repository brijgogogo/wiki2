# Cloud Computing
Virtualization: Not a one-to-one relationship between a physical server and a logical server
Hypervisor: Allows multiple OSs to share the same host, and also manage the resource allocation to virtual OSs

Cloud providers sell everything "as a service".
## Cloud Models
- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Virtual hardware that replaces physical on-premise hardware
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Adds features to IaaS, includes OSs, software development tools, runtime environments.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): Software licensing and delivery model where apps are subscribed to over the internet.

## IaaS
- Compute: provides computing resources on demand.
- Block storage: provides blocks which can be used for information storage.
- Network: provides capabilities of networking to users

## PaaS
- Adds OSs and software
- Runtime environments
- Provisioning and deployment

## Cloud Deployment models

- Private Cloud (on-premise): Own network, Limited Scalability, more security
- Hybrid Cloud: public + private cloud
