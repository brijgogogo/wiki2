# estimating
Tips:

* What figure to give estimates in:
The units you use make a difference in the interpretation of the result.
------------------------------------
Duration       Quote estimate in
------------------------------------
1-15 days      days
3-8 weeks      weeks
8-30 weeks     months
30+ weeks      think hard before giving an estimate
------------------------------------

* ask someone who's already done it. Before you get too committed to
* understanding of what's being asked (scope)
* build a rough and ready bare-bones mental model
* Once you have a model, you can decompose it into components.
* You'll find that each component will typically have parameters that affect how it contributes to the overall model. At this stage, simply identify each parameter.
* assign a value to parameter
Parameters whose values are added into a result are less significant than those that are multiplied or divided. Doubling a line speed may double the amount of data received in an hour, while adding a 5 ms transit delay will have no noticeable effect.
* calculate the answers
Only in the simplest of cases will an estimate have a single answer.
However, as the systems get more complex, you'll want to hedge your answers. Run multiple calculations, varying the values of the critical parameters, until you work out which ones really drive the model. Then couch your answer in terms of these parameters.
* record your estimates so you can see how close you were
If an overall estimate involved calculating subestimates, keep track of these as well.
When an estimate turns out wrong, don't just shrug and walk away. Find out why it differed from your guess.


== Estimating Project Schedules ==
practice incremental development, repeating the following steps:
- Check requirements
- Analyze risk
- Design, implement, integrate
- Validate with the users

Initially, you may have only a vague idea of how many iterations will be required, or how long they may be.
So you complete the coding and testing of the initial functionality and mark this as the end of the first increment. Based on that experience, you can refine your initial guess on the number of iterations and what can be included in each.

Tell management: You'll have to help them understand that the team, their productivity, and the environment will determine the schedule.

== What to Say When Asked for an Estimate ==
You say "I'll get back to you."
You almost always get better results if you slow the process down and spend some time going through the steps (above). Estimates given at the coffee machine will (like the coffee) come back to haunt you.
