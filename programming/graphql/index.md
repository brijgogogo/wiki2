# GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs
It is a specificatin of a query language
implementations: Apollo Client, Relay
strongly-typed query language
allows to cherry-pick the data needed without receiving any extraneous data from the backend

everything goes through a single endpoint, typically named graphql by convention
Declarative solution for communicating with APIs.

When we make parallel data requests, we’re attempting to get all the data we need immediately at the same time. GraphQL was designed to do just that.

A GraphQL query is a declarative description of the data we’re requesting.

GraphQL can work with any network protocol, not just HTTP.

GraphQL is language agnostic.
