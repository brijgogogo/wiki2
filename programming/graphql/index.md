# GraphQL

Declarative solution for communicating with APIs.

When we make parallel data requests, we’re attempting to get all the data we need immediately at the same time. GraphQL was designed to do just that.

A GraphQL query is a declarative description of the data we’re requesting.

GraphQL can work with any network protocol, not just HTTP.

GraphQL is language agnostic.
