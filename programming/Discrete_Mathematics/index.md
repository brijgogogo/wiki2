# Mathematics

* Discrete Mathematics
Study of separable, countable, or quantified objects

Example:
TV Remote
* Power switch - either on/off
* Volume button is variable and continuous
Power switch is discrete with two states on and off.
Volume button is continous since there are values from min to max.

Computers operate in a discrete manner.
Machine language is a series of binary bits, with value of 1 or 0.
