# Code Repository

## central code repository
there is a central place where code resides, you take checkout, make changes and then submit changes back to central repository


## distributed version control
Different users maintain their own repositories
Changes are stored as "change sets" or patches. these tracks changes, not versions.
Change sets can be exchanged between repositories.
No single master repository, just many working copies, each with their own combination of change sets.
No need to communicate with a central server.
No single failure point.
