Workspace: The workspace is the physical location (file path) you are working in.
You can choose the workspace during startup of Eclipse or via the menu (File → Switch Workspace → Others) .

Eclipse projects:  An Eclipse project contains source, configuration and binary files related to a certain task and groups them into buildable and reusable units.

Nature: An Eclipse project can have natures assigned to it which describe the purpose of this project. For example, the Java nature defines a project as Java project. Natures for a project are defined via the .project file in the project directory.

Parts:  Parts are user interface components which allow you to navigate and modify data.
Parts are typically classified into views and editors.

 An example for a view in the Eclipse IDE is the Package Explorer, which allows you to browse the files of Eclipse projects.

 Editors are typically used to modify a single data element, e.g., the content of a file or a data object.

 Perspective: A perspective is an optional container for part stacks and part sash container as well as for a set of parts. Perspectives can be used to store different arrangements of parts. For example, the Eclipse IDE uses them to layout the views appropriate to the task (development, debugging, review, ...) the developer wants to perform.

 You can switch Perspectives via the Window → Open Perspective → Other... menu entry.

 To open a new part in your current perspective, use the Window → Show View → Other... menu entry.
 If you want to reset your current perspective to its default, use the Window → Reset Perspective menu entry.

 You can save the currently selected perspective via Window → Save Perspective As....
