# Wireframe
A sketch or diagram of a web page that shows the structure (but not the detailed design) of basic page elements such as the header, navigation, content area, and footer.

Design techniques to implement wireframes:
1. Fixed layout (solid or ice design)
    - The web page content has a fixed width.
    - Common fixed layout: 960px width in center of browser viewport
    - Disadvantage: Large empty areas in high screen resolutions
2. Fluid layout (liquid layout)
    - Configured with percentage values for widths, often taking up 100% of the borwser viewport.
    - Disadvantage: when displayed in high screen resolutions the line of text may be quite wide. Configuring a maximum width on the text content areas can alleviate the text readability issues.
    - Portions of the design can be configured with a fixed width.

Tip: Whether using fixed or fluid layout, web pages with centered content are typically pleasing to view on a variety of desktop screen resolution.
