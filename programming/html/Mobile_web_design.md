# Mobile web design considerations
- Mobile web users are typically on-the-go, need information quickly, and may be easily distracted.
- Small screen size
- Low bandwidth
- Awkward controls, limited processor, limited memory
- Single-column layout
- To tap, at least 44x22 px size for controls.

Tips:
- Limit scrolling to one direction.
- Use heading elements.
- Use lists to organize information.
- Avoid using tables (as they enforce horizontal and vertical scrolling).
- Provide labels for form controls.
- Avoid using pixel units in sytle sheets.
- Avoid absolute positioning in style sheets.
- Hide content that is not essential for mobile use.
- Provide minimal navigation near the top of the page.
- Provide consistend navigation
- Avoid hyperlinks that open files in new windows or pop-up windows.
- Avoid images wider than screen width (assume 320px screen width)
- Configure alternate small, optimized background images
- Avoid images with text
- Specify the size of images
- Avoid use of large graphic images
- Provide alternate text for graphics and other nontext elements.
- Configure good contrast between text and background colors.
