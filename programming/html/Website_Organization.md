## Website Organization / Sitemap
- Hierarchical
- Linear : useful for tutorial, tour, presentation that needs to be viewed sequentially.
- Random / web organization: no clear path, no discernible structure (usually found on artistic sites)
A diagram of the organization of a website is called a site map.

Tip: This site design needs to be organized into fewer, easily managed topics or units of information, a process called chunking.
Tip: Be aware of the number of major navigation links, try to group them into visually separate sections on the page, with each group having no more than about 4 links.
Tip: interface design "three-click rule": user should be able to get to any page with a maximum of three hyperlinks.
