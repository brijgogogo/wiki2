# Common Tips

- Placing blank/white space in areas around blocks of text or graphics helps them to stand out.
- Arrange interesting content above the fold. With common screen resolution of 1024x768, the amount of screen viewable above the fold (considering browser menus and controls) is about 600 pixels).
"Above the fold": Area of web page visitors sees without scrolling down the page (in newspapers the portion of the page that is above the fold which users see before buying it).
- Avoid placing important information and navigation on the far right side because this area may not be initially displayed by browsers at some screen resolution.
