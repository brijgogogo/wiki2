# Principles of Visual Design
Can be applied to design of just about anything (button, logo, DVD cover, brochure, software interface):
1. Repetition
2. Contrast
3. Proximity
4. Alignment

### Repetition
One or more components are repeated throughout the page. The repeating aspect ties the work together (cohesive look).
Repeating components: color, share, font, images, shapes (button, etc.)


### Contrast
Emphasize the differences between page elements. Makes design interesting and directs user's attention.
Tip: Good contrast between background color and text color to make text readable.

### Proximity
Related items are placed physically together.
Unrelated items should have space separating them.


### Alignment
Each element has some alignment (vertical or horizontal) with another element.
E.g. Columns of equal height.
