# Designing for target audience
- Children / teens: prefer bright, lively colors
- Young adults: prefer dark backgrounds, occasional bright contrast
- Everybody: neutral white background with splashes of color to add interest and highlight page areas.
- Older adults: light backgrounds, well-defined images, large text
