# Universal Windows Platform (UWP)

For writing Windows 10 Store Apps and for targetting Windows 10 devices (mobile, XBox, Surface Hub, Hololens). Your app runs in a sandbox to lessen the thread of malware, prohibiting operations such as reading and writing arbitrary files.


UWP uses .NET Core under the covers.
