# C# 4.0

* dynamic binding
defers the binding (process of resoving types and members) from compile time to runtime, useful in scenarios that would otherwise require complicated reflection code or when interoperating with dynamic languages and COM components.

* optional parameters
allows to specify default parameter values in functions so that caller can omit arguments.

* named arguments
allows a function caller to identify an argument by name rather than position.

* COM interoperability was enhanced
Arguments can be passed by reference without the ref keyword
