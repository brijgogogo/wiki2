Windows Forms wrapped the native Windows controls and was based on pixels, whereas WPF was based on DirectX to draw every control on its own. The vector graphics in WPF allow seamless resizing of every form. The templates in WPF also allow for complete custom looks.

With WPF the user interface can be designed using an XML syntax: XML for Applications Markup Language (XAML).
