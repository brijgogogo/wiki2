# .NET Core
A new cross-platform implementation of .NET

.NET Core is smaller with modular NuGet packages, has a runtime thatâ€™s distributed with every application, is open source, and is available not only for the desktop version of Windows but also for many different Windows devices, as well as for Linux and OS X.


To check whether your application can easily be ported to .NET Core, you can use the .NET Portability Analyzer.
