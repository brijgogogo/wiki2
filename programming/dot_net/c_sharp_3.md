# C# 3.0

* Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
enables queries to be written directly within a C# program and checked statically for correctness.
Query both local collections (lists, xml documents) or remote data sources (databases).

* implicitly typed local variables (`var` keyword)
let you omit the variable type in a declaration statement, allowing the compiler to infer it.

* anonymous types
classes created on the fly that are commonly used in the final output of LINQ queries. Arrays can also be implicitly typed.

* Object initializers
allows properties to be set inline after the constructor call.

* Lambda expressions
miniature functions created by the compiler on the fly

* Extension methods
extend and existing type with new methods

* Query expressions
higher-level syntax for wirting LINQ queries

* Expression trees
miniature code DOMs (Document Object Models) that describe lambda expressions.

* automatic properties

* partial methods
