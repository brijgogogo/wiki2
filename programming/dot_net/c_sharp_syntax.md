# C# Syntax

## identifiers
* name that programmers choose for their classes, methods, variables, and so on.
* made up of Unicode characters starting with a letter or underscore.
* are case-sensitive
* conventions:
  * camel case: parameters, local variables, private fields
  * pascal case: all other identifiers

## keywords
* names that mean something special to the compiler
* are reserved: can't use as identifiers
* if really needed, use @prefix like @class (useful when consuming libraries written in other .NET languages)
* some keywords are contextual (like from, get, add, var), can be used as identifiers

## literals
* primitive pieces of data lexically embedded into the program

## punctuators
* help demarcate the structure of program ({, }, ;)

## operators
* transforms and combines expressions like *, =, ., ()

## comments
// or /* */
