# c#

C# is a general-purpose, type-safe, object-oriented programming language.

The chied architect of the language since its first version is `Anders Hejlsberg` (creator of Turbo Pascal and architect of Delphi).

The C# language is platform-neutral and works with a range of platform-specific compilers and frameworks, most notably the Microsoft .NET Framework for Windows.

The fundamental building block in C# is an encapsulated unit of data and functions called a `type`. All types ultimately share a common base type (unified type system).

In pure object-oriented paradigm, all functions are methods. In C#, methods are only one kind of function members, which also includes properties and events, etc.

`Properties` are function members that encapsulate a piece of an object's state.


C# is primarily a `type-safe` language, meaning that instances of types can interact only through protocols they define, thereby ensuring each type's internal consistency. For instance, C# prevents you from interacting with a string type as though it were an integer type.

More specifically, C# supports `static typing`, meaning that the language enforces type safety at compile time. This is in addition to type safety being enforced at runtime (dynamic typing using `dynamic` keyword).

`strongly typed language` : C#'s type rules (whether enforced statically or at runtime) are very strict. For instance you cannot call a function that's designed to accept an integer with a floating-point number, unless you first explicitly convert the floating-point number to an interger.
