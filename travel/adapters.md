# adapters
The plug you use at home may not work in a wall socket where you are travelling because different countries have different plug shapes.

You cannot use some electronic devices unless they support dual voltate. For example US has 120V electricity, some countries in Europe have 220V electricity.

Adapter: make your device fit in the holes
Converter: changes electric power going into devices

Voltage: voltage refers to electricity. Different countries have different types of electricity.

If your electronics are not dual voltate, use international power converter (transformer).

Blow dryers, flat irons require large power, look for dual voltage in them. If not, better leave them at home. Even convertors cannot support them due to high voltage requirements.

Laptop/tablet:if it says 110-120V, you need convertor. If it says 100-240V, you can use it.


100 watts (or less): small, low-wattage appliances such as small fans, printers and desktop computers.
300 watts: most TVs, electric blankets and refrigerators.
500 watts: blenders, projectors and home cinema systems.
1000 watts: small heaters and stand mixers.
1600 â€“ 2000 watts: hair dryers, dishwashers, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, most appliances that have heating elements such as convector heaters, toasters, deep-frying pans, irons, grills and coffee makers.
3000 watts: tumble dryers and big air conditioners.
