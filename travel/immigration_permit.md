# residence permit
The Irish Residence Permit (IRP) is your registration certificate. You will be given an IRP whenever you register with immigration. Your IRP is a very important document and you must carry it with you at all times.

From 11 December 2017 the new Irish Residence Permit (IRP) has replaced the 'GNIB card'. Do not apply for an IRP until your current GNIB card expires.

An Irish Residence Permit (IRP) indicates:
* That your immigration permission to stay in Ireland has been registered
* The type of immigration permission you have, ie stamp number

You must carry your IRP with you at all times and present it to an immigration officer or a member of An Garda Síochána (police) if requested. This includes whenever you leave or re-enter the country.

If you wish to stay in Ireland past the expiry date on your IRP, you must apply to extend your immigration permission and renew your registration. If successful, you will be given a new IRP.

## fees
An IRP costs €300 per person every time you register and renew. You can pay by:
Bank giro: A giro is a pre-printed form and can be collected from any registration office.
Credit card or debit card: These can be used at Burgh Quay Registration Office and some others.

## processing time
If your register in Dublin, the immigration officer will arrange to send your IRP to you by post. Make sure to confirm your exact address (including Eircode) before you leave the registration office. Your IRP should arrive within 10 to 15 working days.


## Permission stamps
Stamp 1 indicates permission to work or operate a business in Ireland, subject to conditions.
Stamp 3 indicates permission to stay in Ireland for a specified period, subject to conditions. (Join Family)
Stamp 4: stay, work, join family

## appointment
New appointments every weekday at 10am and 2:30pm.
