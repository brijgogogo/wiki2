AI models are foundational to artificial intelligence systems, enabling applications like natural language processing, facial recognition, and self-driving cars.

## LLM
LLM stands for Large Language Model, which is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model specifically designed to process, understand, and generate human-like text. These models leverage deep learning techniques and massive datasets to perform various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, and question answering.
