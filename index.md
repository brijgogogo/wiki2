## SSDs
SSDs can either use NVMe or SATA as the method for communicating with the rest of a PC. SATA is slower than NVMe.
M.2 is a type of form factor. You can find both NVMe M.2 and SATA M.2 SSDs.
NVMe transfer rates depend first on which generatioin of PCIe connector your NVMe drive uses (PCIe 3.0 @ 3500MB per second, 4.0 @ 7500MB per second)then on the model.
SATA SSDs typically hit upto 500MB per second.
SATA HDDs tops out at around 160MB per second.
SATA SSDs can take the form of either 2.5-inch drives or M.2 drives.

## SWIFT
- Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications.
- Way to handle cross-border payments
- Based in Belgium, formed in 1973
- averages 40 million messages per day (orders, payment confirmations, FX exchanges, trades, etc)
- doesn't actually do any transfer or holding of funds, but part of communication infrastructure

## AI Model
An AI model refers to a computer program designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. It is trained on datasets to identify patterns, make predictions, or automate decision-making without constant human intervention. AI models are foundational to artificial intelligence systems, enabling applications like natural language processing, facial recognition, and self-driving cars.

## LLM
LLM stands for Large Language Model, which is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) model specifically designed to process, understand, and generate human-like text. These models leverage deep learning techniques and massive datasets to perform various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, and question answering.

## Perplexity
Perplexity is a free AI-powered search engine. It searches the internet in real-time, identifies relevant sources, and generates high-quality answers. Perplexity prioritizes accuracy and reliable answers, aiming to serve as your definitive source for knowledge discovery.

## Design Thinking: problem-solving methodology
1. Empathize: Deep user research to understand their behaviors, motivations, and pain points.
2. Define: Synthesize insights into clear problem statements focused on the users’ needs.
3. Ideate: Generate a broad range of creative ideas without constraints.
4. Prototype: Build scaled-down models or tangible solutions to explore ideas.
5. Test: Experiment with prototypes in real scenarios to gather feedback and refine the solution.
