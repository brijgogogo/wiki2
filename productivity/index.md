# productivity

* Purpose, talent, passions
* Discipline
Continuinty to work and make progress out of habit.
Discipline is better than motivation.
`Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work`
`We are what we repeatedly do`
`What you do every day is more important than what you do once in a while`
Constant, relentless action
Productivity is about doing the right things consistently.

Momentum and inertia are the key determinants of consistent productivity.

Start making conscious efforts to choose solutions over distractions until it becomes a concrete habit.

* busy vs productive
Being busy does not inherently makey you productive.
Busy people are like scattered brains, have lots of goals.
Productive people have priorities.
Busy people say yes to almost everything.
Productive people are selective and aren't afraid to say no.

`I'm as proud of many of the things we haven't done as the things we have done. Innovation is saying no to a thousand things` - Steve Jobs

The Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) : 80% of the results comes from the 20% of the causes.

Don't try to do it all.
Productiviy isn't about doing many things, its about doing the right thing consistently.

* Will power is a finite resource
Throughout the day you filter out distractions, resist temptations, make tough decisions, or generally do something you don't like, your will power is depleted. When you run out of will power you give in to distractions and bad habits.

Conserve your will power, by eliminating distractions. The less distractions you have the less will power you need to resist them.

* Multitasking is a myth

* Attention is finite
quit social media, gaming
schedule a time, allow yourself to indulge for 15-30 minutes.

* Make yourself difficult to reach when you really need your time to be on your game.
Batch email at the end of the day, if you can.
Do an email cleanse.
Take charge of your time, and avoid living on other people's schedule.

* Minimize amount of time spent on meeting
Attend meetings where you can contribute and benefit in a significant way.

* Eliminate your personal procrastination triggers
Your environment plays a big role in your productivity, so optimize it as much as it can.
Keep things like TV, phone (on do not disturb), game console as far as possible.

* Information overload (paralysis by analysis)
Education should be a solution not a distraction.
Make sure to apply what you learn.

* Assign value to your time
Outsource/delete your tasks which are not worth your time.
Do things that only you can do.

* Be early riser
No distractions
No ego/will depletion. We have most will power when we wake up.
Good time for planning and reflection.
Sets the flow the day.

How to wake up early:
1) Go to bed when you're too tired to stay up
2) Set an alarm to wake up at a fixed time every day
In morning, get up from bed quickly. The more you stay, you will roll over and sleep.

* There are only two things you need to focus on...
1) Your overall vision and goals for your life
2) Actionable tasks

* Conduct an annual review (December end)
Review what's working, what's not working for the current year.
Set measurable goals for next year.
Plan actions to achive goals.
Set deadlines for goals.
Categorize goals into health, travel, savings, miles run etc.
Review every quarter of year.

* Conduct weekly review
Plan work, add them to task manager
Review completed tasks of gone week
Review long term goals
What went well, what didn't go well, what should I stop doing, what should I start doing, what should I continue doing...
Schedule priority tasks.
Monday 5AM ??

* Don't tell your goals to others
It gives false sense of accomplishment.
The goal may change as a year goes on. Social pressure may pressure you to still pursue it.

* Use a task manager like Todoist

* Develop a strong work ethic
Hard work is not overworking. It is not about hours, it is about results.
Don't give up family time, social life.
Take inventory of your day.

* Just get started
Just do a tiny bit, then momentum will take you further.
Motivation is the result of action.

* Imppose your own deadlines and force yourself into a state of urgency.
Set strict, but realistic timelines.

* Pomodoro technique (25 mins work,5 mins break * 4, 30 mins break * 1)
Take break between tasks.
Breaking up your work will help you maintain your focus and flow.

* Batch similar tasks

* Music
For repetitive tasks music is efficient
Helpful in noise environment.
Lyrics can be distracting.
Depends on type of music.
Not good for immersive work like analysis.

noisli.com (ambient background noise)

* Done list
track accomplishments

* Don't let perfect be the enemy of good
You're not going to optimize every minute of your life.
Accept it
Be comfortable with imperfection
Remember what you are working towards
Get back to business

* Create a healthy balance
take breaks, you don't have to work 24/7
Make sure you are in control of your breaks.
