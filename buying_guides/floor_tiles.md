  - stain resistant
  - slip resistant


## Types
- Ceramic floor tiles
  - made from clay, mineral, water-solution
  - if glazed, then waterproof
  - unglazed, gives natural look, but are only water resistant, not water proof
  - suitable for bathroom, kitchen, or shower floor tile
  - more affordable alternative to natural stone

- Porcelain floor tile
  - ceramic, but more durable and dense
  - created using fused clay minerals and water
  - waterproof whether glazed or not
  - good choice for areas with a lot of moisture

- Natural stone tile
  - natural patterns in stones
  - expensive
  - requires more upkeep

## Styles
  - wood look
  - stone look
    - marble: clean, classic look
    - limestone: limestone look
    - travertine: popular in neutral brown tones, appears more textured
    - slate: often in darker natural tones with high color variation
  - pattern

## Shapes
  - plank: shaped like natural wook plank
  - subway/rectangle
  - circles
  - designer shapes
  - squares

## Pattern
  - Grid/stacked
  - diagonal
  - offset/staggeredS brick: end of one tile is centered over the tile below it

## Finishes
  - glazed: protects tile from moisture, stains. Can cause tiles to be slippery when wet (use textured in bathroom)
  - polished: polished porcelain tiles. Protects from absorbing dirt and debris
  - Unglazed: no extra finish after firing. Look more earthy, natural. Not easy to maintain, and not water proof.
