## Headphone buying guide

- Drivers
  Drivers produce waves that our ears pick up.
  Drivers size: 6-12mm in earphones, 20-50mm in standard headphones
  The general advantage of having larger drivers is more controlled bass, but is not necessarily louder and more powerful.
  Dynamic drivers: coil, magnet. Simplest technology, most available.
  Planar magnetic drivers: sophisticated listening. Two magnetic fields. Increased clarity, and more accurate soundscape.
  Electrostatic drivers: powered through electrostatic amplifier (or energizer).
- Impedance, measured in ohms: the lower this is, the less power your will need to drive the headphones, and vice versa.
  If a headphone has an impedance of 1-32ohm, it can be powered by something like a smartphone.
  33-100ohm may require a portable amplifier to push a high volume out of the headphones.
  Over 100ohm will need amplifier.
  The higher the ohm the better the headphones treat the electrical current, producing richer sound.
- Frequency, measured in Hz or kHz. Humans can hear frequencies up to 20,000Hz. If headphones support more, it means it can easily produce sounds in very high frequencies.
