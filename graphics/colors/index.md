# Colors

## Color Theory
The theory of how colors mix, contrast, and affect those that view them.

## Color Modes / Models
1. Subtractive Mode / Traditional Model (CMYK)
  - used primarily with printing (magazines, posters)
  - primary colors: CMY (cyan, magenta, yellow)
  - When CMY are printed over each other they produce darker colors
  - K - Black - used for deeper blacks or contrasts
  - Mixing C, M, Y produces near Black
  - Subtractive: as we add color we are subtracting the amount of reflected light
  - Traditional model was developed to describe the appearance of physical mediums such as paint and ink. Physical mediums reflect light instead of emitting it (hence its called Subtractive). If you mix all colors, it becomes black (colors are subtracted).
2. Additive Mode ? Digital Model (RGB)
  - used where color will be represented digitally (tv, monitors, tablets, phones, projectors, etc.)
  - Primary colors: RGB (cannot be created by combining other colors)
  - Mixing RGB produces white
  - additive: we are increasing the amount of light and all of the light equals white
  - When we mix light things get brighter. Pixels in computer screens emit light


## Common Terms

- Hue: The most noticeable color that stands out to your eye

- Value: Lightness or darkness of a color relative to others around it

- Tint = Hue + white
- Shade = Hue + black
- Tone = Hue + gray

- A shade of a color is darker than the original color and is created by mixing the color with black.
- A tint of a color is lighter than the original color and is created by mixing the color with white.
- A tone of a color has less saturation than the original color and is created by mixing the color with gray.

Tints, shades and tones weaken the intensity of a color which results in desaturation.

- Saturation / Chroma
As black, white or gray are added to a pure hue the briallance of the hue becomes neutralized.


## Color Wheel
  - Represents every possible color is represented in the gradient color wheel
  - Pure hue on the outer edge, and white in the middle

Circle of colors depicting the:
1. Primary colors (red, green, and blue)
2. Secondary colors: by mixing two primary colors
  - Red + Blue = Magenta
  - Blue + Gree = Cyan
  - Green + Red = Yellow
3. Tertiary Colors: by mixing secondary and primary colors
  - Blue + Magenta = Violet
  - Blue + Cyan = Azure
  - Cyan + Green = Spring Green
  - Green + Yellow = Chartreuse
  - Yello + Red = Orange
  - Red + Magenta = Rose

## Color Temperature
  - Split the wheel into two
  - One side has Absolute warm colors like (yellows, oranges, reds)
  - Other side has Absolute color (blues,
  - Color temperature is relative to the colors around it
    - Red is warmer than yellow
    - Blue is colder than cyan
  - Warm: fire, sunlight -> energetic, powerful, anger
  - Cool: water, grass -> calm and relaxing
  - Neutral colors: gray, white, black : not as much emotional response


## Color Palettes / Color Schemes

### Color schemes
- One color is typically dominant.
- Other colors are configured as accents such as colors for headings, subheadings, borders, list markers, backgrounds.
- Neutral colors: applicable to all schemes (white, off-white, gray, black, brown)
- Use tints, shades or tones of primary, secondary, and tertiary colors.
- Accent color: used as the background for page elements such as call-to-action buttons and text that you want to make sure the reader doesn't miss. As such, it should be a bold, unmistakable hue that stands out.
- Secondary color: used as the background for some of the content bands. It should be similar to accent color: bold enough to tell the reader that the content is important but not so bold that it clashes with or overshadows the accent color
- Tertiary color: used as background for content that's less important


1. Triadic Color Palettes:
  - Any three colors evenly spaced in the color wheel
  - Vivid and well-balanced
  - Tip: Choose one dominant color and use the other two as accent colors
  - consists of three colors that are equidistant on the color wheel (e.g. blue-green(teal), yello-orange, red-violet)

2. Analogous Palettes
  - Colors that are connected to one another by a common trait (main color and two colors that are adjacent to it on the color wheel (e.g. orange, red-orange, yellow-orange))
    - next ot each other on the color wheel
    - considered harmonious and calming since the colors are related in hues

3. Monochromatic palettes
  - use variations of a single hue (contsists of shades, tints, or tones of the same color)
  - expand the single hue into an entire swatch by introducing tints, shade, tones
  - considered calming, minimalist, visually unobtrusive
  - Tip: ensure there is enouch difference in value between colors

4. Achromatic Pallettes
  - Palette of values between black and white
  - Minimalist but can have plenty of contrast

5. Complimentary Palettes
  - colors that are opposite from each other on the color wheel (contrasting colors) (consists of two colors that are opposite each other (e.g. yellow and violet). (main-color, complementary-color))
  - Appear appealing to the eye as their contrast is high, and thus easy to discern from one another.
  - Contrast affects readability, professionalism or unprofessionalism of UI, so choose wisely.
  - Stimulates different photoreceptors/parts in our eyes or brains
  - Tip: use tints, tones and shades of colors (otherwise too vivid)

6. Split-Complimentary Palettes
  - Strikes a middle-ground between contrast and harmony (key color, two adjacent colors of color opposite to key color)
  - consists of a main color, the opposite colors on the color wheel (the complement) and two colors adjacent to the complement. (e.g. yellow (main), violet (complementary), red-violet, and blue-violet)
  - Energetic without tension
  - Easier to balance than a complimentary pallete
  - Combines advantages of Alalogous Palettes and Complementary Palettes

7. Tetradic
  - consists of 4 colors which are two complimentary pairs (e.g. yellow and violet, yellow-green and red-violet)

Similar: Rectangle Complimentary (draw rectangle in color wheel), Square Complementary

## Color Harmnony
- Color Harmony
  Concordance between individual color elements across the composition.
  - E.g. Acromatic, Monocromatic - utilizes color consonance
    Color Consonance: agreement and predictability between colors
  - E.g. Complementary Palettes - they are hamonious as they balance each other out

- Color Discord
  clashing color combinations don't make sense in relation to what we're used to seeing in life.
  - Generally widely separated on the color wheel and not assiciated with a palette structure.
  - Dicort is not strictly the opposite of harmony, it the absence of concurrence between individual elements.

- Color Concurrence
  Occurs when the color and compositional elements are aesthetically agreeable.


## Color psychology
Blue, gray - sense of dependability and trust (good for business-like appearance)
Red, yellow, orange - For excitement, festive, fun atmosphere
Brown and yellow - safe, comfortable ambiance
Green and brown - environmental touch


## Color
RGB - represented by 0-255, usually in hexadecimal

"#" symbol signifies that the value is in decimal.

Red: #FF0000
Green: #00FF00
Blue: #0000FF
Black: #000000
White: #FFFFFF
Grey: #CCCCCC
yellow: #FFFF00
orange: #FFA500
skyblue: #87CEEB
wheat: #F5DEB3

ghostwhite: #F8F8FF
lightpink: #FFB6C1
lightsalmon: #FFA07A
teal: #008080
yellowgreen: #9ACD32
mistyrose: #FFE4E1


## Web-safe Colors
Web-safe hexadecimal values: 00, 33, 66, 99, CC, FF
Today it is less important to use web-safe colors since most video drivers support millions of colors.
