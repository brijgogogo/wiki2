## Font Categories
5 main categorie to distinguish most typefaces:
1. Serif
  - contains fine cross strokes (called feet or serif) at the extremities of each character.
  - Give traditional, classy look. Get lost when displayed on a screen at small sizes.
  - Examples: Times New Roman, Georgia, Palatino
  - works best for headings, other text set at large sizes

2. Sans serif
  - Doesn't contain cross strokes on the extremities of characters.
  - usually have a clean, modern look that's well suited to screen text, particularly at small sizes.
  - Examples: Arial, Tahoma, Helvetica, Verdana
  - works best for body text

3. Monospace
  - fixed-width - uses the same amount of space for each character. Skinny characters (i, l), take same space as wider letters (m, w)
  - Examples: Courier New, Lucida Console
  - works well for code listings

4. Cursive (Script fonts)
  - resembles handwritten pen or brush writing
  - Examples: Lucida Handwriting, Brush Script, Comic Sans MS, Edwardian Script
  - best for short bits of text that require elegance or playfulness

5. Fantasy
  - fanciful designs - extreme elements (like extra thick)
  - Examples: Jokerman, Impact, Papyrus
  - best for special effect
