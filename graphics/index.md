# Graphics


- [colors](colors/index.md) (color theory)
- [typography](./typography/index.md)


## Design Roles
1. Visual Design
  - creating the look, style, layout and feel of a website or digital application
2. Graphic Design
  - Creating print and deliverable content (business cards, flyers, signage, etc.)
  - Digital age: logo, icons, banners
3. UX Design
  - Oversees broad UI design
  - Research with users to understand them better, wireframe design, UI structure
4. Web Design
  - Focuses specifically on websites
  - May also have coding skills



## Composition
The structure and arrangement of an interface's elements.
- Dictates the way in which user navigates the UI.

Common tools used for composition
1. Grids
  - provide visual organization and consistency to a design
  - the human mind naturally wants to sort elements into groups, so grids play to our innate preferences.
2. Emphasis and Scaling
  - Used to draw user's attention
  - to provide context to user
  - E.g. Header / Page Title
3. Balance
  - Proper use of whitepace
  - size of text, color
  - text-alignment
4. Continuation
  - intentionally cutting the viewport of the grid to imply that user should scroll down


## Tools
- Adobe Photoshop (Raster images)
- Adobe Illustrator (Vector Images)
- [gimp](./gimp/index.md)
- Adobe InDesign (arranges content: wireframes, books)
- Adobe XD (UI Rapid Prototyping tool)



## Raster Images
- A Raster is a bitmap, i.e., a map of bits.
- Bitmap images: A grid of pixels with color and transparency values.
- Usage: Great for high-detail images like photos or backdrops
- E.g. jpeg, png, tiff
- Drawback: cannot be scaled up in size without losing quality

## Vector Images
- Uses vertexes instead of pixels (as in Raster images)
- Collection of vertexes that conect to form polygons
- Positions, colors and transparency values of each vertex in vector file.
- Shape is drawn mathematically, hence can be scaled up or down, without losing quality.
- Usage: logo
- Drawback: Level of details that can be easily achieved with Raster image is much more time consuming and difficult.
